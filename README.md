# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
### For this analysis I'm working for the company Pewlett-Hackard to help the company prepare for the "silver tsunami" or retirement wave that is coming. I used SQL to merge and create new data frames to show the number of Retiring Employees by Title, and the Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program to fill those retirement roles.

### Here is a table that shows how many employees are retireing based on title.

### As you can see there is a total of 72,458 people retiring soon from the company leaving many spots to be filled!

### Here is the top and bottom of the mentorship table I put together that shows there are still not enough employees to mentor and fill all those holes. There is a total of 1,550 mentors that our eligible.
